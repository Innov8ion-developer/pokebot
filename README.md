# Exercise 2 #

If you now understood how create a basic bot, and what entities, skills and intents are, let's add them to our bot.



Create an intent

![Alt text](/../screenshots/part2/Picture13.png?raw=true "")

Train the intent – normally you would check with your users/call logs

##Create a Entity##

![Alt text](/../screenshots/part2/Picture15.png?raw=true "")

Call it Pokemon and use “Restricted”
![Alt text](/../screenshots/part2/Picture16.png?raw=true "")

Add synonyms, so you do need to train the bot as hard

Or add a lot of them via a CSV upload!

Now you have Entities, you can tag them in your Intent
